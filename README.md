# TMU Libraries Digital Preservation Guide

This repository is TMU Libraries' guide for processing and uploading digitized and born-digital materials for digital preservation purposes. It is a living document and will be updated as policies and procedures change.

Before starting a large transfer, check there is sufficient storage space under Administration>Processing Storage Usage. Archivematica generally works on a 1:4 scale, where a transfer can be at most 25% of available processing space. For a transfer of 150GB, roughly 600GB of disk space should be sufficient to process the transfer although additional space will also be needed for AV normalization. Email permafrost@scholarsportal.info when disk usage is high and needs to be deleted.
